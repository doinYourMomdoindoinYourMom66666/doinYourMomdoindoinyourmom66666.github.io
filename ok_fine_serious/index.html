            <h1>About this epic game</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Pogs a Million: RUGGED ACTION is competitive Rug-Em-Up.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Your name</b> is Big Basin Prairie Preserve, better known as “Dave”. You are tasked with selling stolen rugs to the prolific Turkmenistani underground rug markets without being caught by the country’s dictator Gurbanguly Mälikgulyýewiç Berdimuhamedow.
                <br><br><b>The game’s genre</b> is a hand-crafted genre I call a “rug-em-up”; inspired by the shoot ‘em up genre, it is defined by having the objective of delivering large quantities of rugs across the game world.
                <br><br><b>Pogs a Million’s</b> theme is whatever assets I can throw together from the asset store.
                <br><br><b>Its gameplay includes</b> high-octane rug-movement action, including looking at rugs, picking up rugs, moving rugs, and putting down rugs. It’s also required to sneak around the rug dictator, Gurbanguly Mälikgulyýewiç Berdimuhamedow, to restore ruggy justice to the flag of Turkmenistan.
            </p>
